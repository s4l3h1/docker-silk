## This is a /bin/sh file that gets loaded by the init.d/rwflowpack

# Set to non-empty value to enable rwflowpack
ENABLED=yes

# These are convenience variables for setting other values in this
# configuration file; their use is not required.

# If CREATE_DIRECTORIES is set to "yes", the directories named in this
# file will be created automatically if they do not already exist
CREATE_DIRECTORIES=yes

# Full path of the directory containing the "rwflowpack" program
BIN_DIR=/usr/local/sbin

# The full path to the sensor configuration file.  Used by
# --sensor-configuration.  YOU MUST PROVIDE THIS (the value is ignored
# when INPUT_MODE is "respool").
SENSOR_CONFIG=/data/sensors.conf

# The full path to the root of the tree under which the packed SiLK
# Flow files will be written.  Used by --root-directory.
DATA_ROOTDIR=/data

# The full path to the site configuration file.  Used by
# --site-config-file.  If not set, defaults to silk.conf in the
# ${DATA_ROOTDIR}.
SITE_CONFIG=/data/silk.conf

# Specify the path to the packing-logic plug-in that rwflowpack should
# load and use.  The plug-in provides functions that determine into
# which class and type each flow record will be categorized and the
# format of the files that rwflowpack will write.  When SiLK has been
# configured with hard-coded packing logic (i.e., when
# --enable-packing-logic was specified to the configure script), this
# value should be empty.  A default value for this switch may be
# specified in the ${SITE_CONFIG} site configuration file.  This value
# is ignored when INPUT_MODE is "respool".
PACKING_LOGIC=

# Data input mode.  Valid values are:
#  * "stream" mode to read from the network or from probes that have
#    poll-directories
#  * "fcfiles" to process flowcap files on the local disk
#  * "respool" to process SiLK flow files maintaining the sensor and
#    class/type values that already exist on those records.
INPUT_MODE=stream

# Directory in which to look for incoming flowcap files in "fcfiles"
# mode or for incoming SiLK files in "respool" mode
INCOMING_DIR=${statedirectory}/incoming

# Directory to move input files to after successful processing.  When
# in "stream" mode, these are the files passed to any probe with a
# poll-directory directive.  When in "fcfiles" mode, these are the
# flowcap files.  When in "respool" mode, these are the SiLK Flow
# files.  If not set, the input files are not archived but are deleted
# instead.
ARCHIVE_DIR=${statedirectory}/archive

# When using the ARCHIVE_DIR, normally files are stored in
# subdirectories of the ARCHIVE_DIR.  If this variable's value is 1,
# files are stored in ARCHIVE_DIR itself, not in subdirectories of it.
FLAT_ARCHIVE=0

# Directory to move an input file into if there is a problem opening
# the file.  If this value is not set, rwflowpack will exit when it
# encounters a problem file.  When in "fcfiles" mode, these are the
# flowcap files.  When in "stream" mode, these are the files passed to
# any probe with a poll-directory directive.
ERROR_DIR=  #${statedirectory}/error

# Data output mode.  Valid values are "local" and "remote".  "local"
# writes the hourly data files to the local disk.  "remote" creates
# small files (called incremental files) that must be processed by
# rwflowappend to create the hourly files.
OUTPUT_MODE=local

# Directory in which the incremental files are written when the
# OUTPUT_MODE is "remote".  Typically there is an rwsender deamon that
# polls this directory for new incremental files.
SENDER_DIR=${statedirectory}/sender-incoming

# Temporary directory in which to build incremental files prior to
# handing them to rwsender.  Used only when OUTPUT_MODE is "remote".
INCREMENTAL_DIR=${statedirectory}/incremental


# The type of compression to use for packed files.  Left empty, the
# value chosen at compilation time will be used.  Valid values are
# "best" and "none".  Other values are system-specific (the available
# values are listed in the description of the --compression-method
# switch in the output of rwflowpack --help).
COMPRESSION_TYPE=

# Interval between attempts to check the INCOMING_DIR or
# poll-directory probe entries for new files, in seconds.  This may be
# left blank, and will default to 15.
POLLING_INTERVAL=

# Interval between periodic flushes of open SiLK Flow files to disk,
# in seconds.  This may be left blank, and will default to 120.
FLUSH_TIMEOUT=

# Maximum number of SiLK Flow files to have open for writing
# simultaneously.  This may be left blank, and will default to 64
FILE_CACHE_SIZE=

# Whether rwflowpack should use advisory write locks.  1=yes, 0=no.
# Set to zero if messages like "Cannot get a write lock on file"
# appear in rwflowpack's log file.
FILE_LOCKING=1

# Whether rwflowpack should include the input and output SNMP
# interfaces and the next-hop-ip in the output files.  1=yes, 0=no.
# The default is no, and these values are not stored to save disk
# space.  (The input and output fields contain VLAN tags when the
# sensor.conf file contains the attribute "interface-values vlan".)
PACK_INTERFACES=0


###

# The type of logging to use.  Valid values are "legacy" and "syslog".
LOG_TYPE=legacy

# The lowest level of logging to actually log.  Valid values are:
# emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug
LOG_LEVEL=info

# The full path of the directory where the log files will be written
# when LOG_TYPE is "legacy".
LOG_DIR=/var/log

# The full path of the directory where the PID file will be written
PID_DIR=${LOG_DIR}

# The user this program runs as; root permission is required only when
# rwflowpack listens on a privileged port.
